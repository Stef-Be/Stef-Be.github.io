          <p>I take weekly piano and composition lessons and play in a jazz ensemble. I have a soft spot for video game music. Combine this with jazz and you get <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-4OxmD4AocU&t=0s">my favourite music genre</a>
            Together with my teacher, I composed the music for my brother's graduation project. </p>

      <h1 hidden="true">Sports</h1>
        <p>Because of my paramedical background, I like to keep fit. Soccer, bouldering, hiking... As long as it has a social and/or nature component.
           As a developer, I expect my screentime to rise (even more). I'd like to balance this out with the above.</p>

      <h1 hidden="true">Gaming</h1>
        <p>Gaming in all forms. Mostly story-driven RPG's on PC. It's like reading, but you get to choose the outcome. We also really enjoy tabletop gaming with friends and we are currently running the Curse of Strahd, a Dungeons & Dragons campaign.</p>
