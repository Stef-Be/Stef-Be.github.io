        <h1>Music Theory</h1>
          <p>For my technical subject, I'd like to talk about what makes a song "happy" or "sad". You could say "because it sounds happy/sad.", and you would be absolutely right. I could stop writing right here.
          With music theory however, we like to delve a little deeper and try to explain why something actually sounds the way it sounds.
          As music theory is an insanely broad subject, I'd like to focus on one easily recognizable topic.</p>

      <section class="difference">
        <h2>Major vs. Minor</h2>
          <p>Even as a total music noob, you will instantly hear the difference. Songs in a major key tend to sound 'bright, happy, hopeful', while minor key songs sound "sad, gloomy, dejected".
          There are some obvious exceptions. Most people won't label <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rOiW_xY-kc">Everybody Hurts - R.E.M.</a>, a song in D major, as a happy song. Ironically, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZbZSe6N_BXs">Happy by Pharell Williams</a>, is written in the key of F minor.
          This goes to show that a lot goes into the emotional quality of a song. Tempo, choice of instruments, lyrics,... all combine to make a song sound "happy" or "sad".
          In isolation though, major and minor keys are associated with joy and sadness, respectively. But there is nothing inherently sad or joyful about music. It's just air vibrating at different frequencies. Why then do we assign these emotions to songs?
          </p>
        </section>
        <section class="chords">
        <h2>Chords</h2>
        <p>The building blocks of almost all songs are chords: three or more notes played together. They are built based on the major and minor scales, both series of 7 notes. The only difference is the tonal distance between those 7 notes.
          C major (C-E-G) consists of three notes from the C major scale. C minor (C-E♭-G) is built off of the C minor scale. Only the middle note differs: E♭ is half a step lower than E.
          This half step difference has a big impact: most people clearly hear the emotional difference between the two chords.
          Most of the chords (that actually drive the harmony) used in major songs are major chords, while minor songs mostly use minor chords.
          But we still don't know why a minor chord (and thus a song in a minor key) sounds "sad".</p>
            <aside>What do you think about <a href ="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbTxfN8d2CI">Be Worry, Don't Happy</a>, rewritten to their relative minor key? Changing the key and switching up some words make a drastic difference.</aside>
        </section>
        <section class="reason">
        <h2>Nature vs. nurture</h2>
        <p>The same debate exists in behavioural science, biology, sociology,... Is a trait acquired (nurture) or are we born with it (nature)?
           In music theory, we might make a case for both. The most cited reason for "major = happy and minor = sad" is conditioning. Like Pavlov's dogs, we see Frodo Baggings vibing in the Shire on a song in a major key, while he gets packaged as food by a giant spider accompanied by ominous strings playing a song in a minor key.
           There Comes the Bride is major and the Funeral March is minor. Yoda's theme is major, Vader's theme is minor. As music is ubiquitous, this conditioning starts at a very young age.</p>
        </p>
           <p>More recently, a possible reason might also be found in nature. Sound is air vibrating. Air vibrating at a higher frequency will have a higher pitch.
              But, excluding pure sine waves, a real musical note will actually vibrate at multiple frequencies. If I play the note C on the piano, you will hear it's fundamental frequency: the note C.
              However, multiple higher frequencies will occur simultaneously. You might not consciously hear them, but they are there. The first six of these naturally occuring frequencies are only notes of the C major chord! Music theorists argue that the major key thus naturally gets associated with "stability, consonance, normalcy".
              All is well in the world of the major chord. It follows that minor keys, straying from this natural order, get associated with "instability, dissonance, unease". Try not to feel uneasy listening to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JyFrIH2-ns"> Every Breath You Take</a> in a minor key...
